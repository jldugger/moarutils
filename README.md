[![shellcheck](https://github.com/jldugger/moarutils/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jldugger/moarutils/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A community housing project for CLI tools too lazy to live independently

## Philosophy

Tools in moarutils should conform to the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing well. Or in our case, kinda okay.
We will reject your housing application if it:

• does too many things  
• fails to do [the dishes](https://www.shellcheck.net/) regularly  
• is [too good](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/)

## What's Included

trim: remove trailing and leading whitespace
