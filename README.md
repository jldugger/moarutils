# moarutils
A collection of tools too dumb to live independently

## Philosophy

Tools in moarutils should conform to the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing well. Or in our case, kinda okay.
We will reject your tool if it:

• does too many things  
• is [too good](https://joeyh.name/code/moreutils/)

## What's Included

trim: remove trailing and leading whitespace
